## 🗄️ Database Schema

| Table             | Description                                     |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `users`           | User accounts (username, email, password hash)  |
| `boards`          | Project boards with background colour           |
| `lists`           | Ordered columns within a board                  |
| `cards`           | Tasks within a list (title, description, due)   |
| `labels`          | Colour-coded labels scoped to a board           |
| `card_labels`     | Many-to-many: cards ↔ labels                    |
| `card_members`    | Many-to-many: cards ↔ users                     |
| `checklists`      | Named checklists attached to cards              |
| `checklist_items` | Individual items within a checklist             |

Foreign keys cascade on delete so removing a board removes all its lists, cards, etc.
